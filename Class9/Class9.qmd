## PDB statistics

```{r}
#read the csv file
pdbstats <- read.csv("Data_Export_Summary.csv")
knitr::kable(pdbstats)
```

>Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy.

```{r}
#use `gsub` to remove comma in the dataset and read it as numbers
xray <- as.numeric(gsub(",", "", pdbstats$X.ray))
em <- as.numeric(gsub(",", "", pdbstats$EM))
total <- as.numeric(gsub(",", "", pdbstats$Total))
```

```{r}
#calculate the percentage
sum(xray)/sum(total)
sum(em)/sum(total)
```

```{r}
#create a function to convert characters to numbers
char2numsum <- function(x){
  sum(as.numeric(gsub(",", "", x)))
}
```

```{r}
char2numsum(pdbstats$X.ray)/char2numsum(pdbstats$Total)
char2numsum(pdbstats$EM)/char2numsum(pdbstats$Total)
```


>Q2: What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?

```{r}
char2numsum(pdbstats$Total[1])/char2numsum(pdbstats$Total)
```

>Q3: Type HIV in the PDB website search box on the home page and determine how many HIV-1 protease structures are in the current PDB?

If search HIV-1 protease, it gives 2396 results. 

# Use the Molstar viewer

Here is a wee image from Molstar

>Q4: Water molecules normally have 3 atoms. Why do we see just one atom per water molecule in this structure?

The resolution of this 3d structure is not as high that can show the hydrogen atom, so only shows oxygen atom. 

>Q5: There is a critical “conserved” water molecule in the binding site. Can you identify this water molecule? What residue number does this water molecule have?

Yes there is. It's annotated in the figure above. The residue number is HOH308. 


>Q6: Generate and save a figure clearly showing the two distinct chains of HIV-protease along with the ligand. You might also consider showing the catalytic residues ASP 25 in each chain and the critical water (we recommend “Ball & Stick” for these side-chains). Add this figure to your Quarto document.

Figure shown above. 

# Let's do some bioinformatic with these things.

We are going to use the `bio3d` package for structural bioinformatics.

```{r}
library(bio3d)

p <- read.pdb("1hsg")
p
```

>Q7: How many amino acid residues are there in this pdb object? 

```{r}
length(p$seqres)
```

>Q8: Name one of the two non-protein residues?

MK1 - the ligand. 

>Q9: How many protein chains are in this structure? 

There are 2 chains, A and B. 


```{r}
head(p$atom)
```

>Q. What is the resid for the first atom?

```{r}
#two ways to do it
p$atom[1,"resid"]
p$atom$resid[1]
```

```{r}
aa321(p$atom$resid[1])
```

Let's do a Normal Mode Analysis (NMA)

```{r}
#read an input structure "6s36"
adk <- read.pdb("6s36")
adk
```

Now for our nma

```{r}
#Do the NMA
m <- nma(adk)
plot(m)
```

Make a viz of this motion for Molstar

```{r}
#Make a trajectory file
mktrj(m, file="adk_m7.pdb")
```


# Now for comparative analysis of protein structure

First we will extract the seq from a protein we are interested in.

```{r}
aa <- get.seq("1ake_A")
aa
```

>Q13. How many amino acids are in this sequence, i.e. how long is this sequence?

214 AAs are in this sequence. 


Now search against the PDB database for related structures.

```{r}
b <- blast.pdb(aa)
```
```{r}
hits <- plot(b)
```

```{r}
hits
```

```{r}
#view the PDB id of related structures
hits$pdb.id
```


Now we will download all these structures

```{r}
#DOWNLOAD RELATED PDB FILES
files <- get.pdb(hits$pdb.id, path="pdbs", split=T, gzip = T)
```


## Align and superpose (i.e. fit on top of each other)

```{r}
# Align related PDBs
pdbs <- pdbaln(files, fit = TRUE, exefile="msa")
```


And let's see the output

```{r}
pdbs
```

Now for the PCA

```{r}
# Perform PCA
pc.xray <- pca(pdbs)
plot(pc.xray)
```

```{r}
# Calculate RMSD
rd <- rmsd(pdbs)

# Structure-based clustering
hc.rd <- hclust(dist(rd))
grps.rd <- cutree(hc.rd, k=3)

plot(pc.xray, 1:2, col="grey50", bg=grps.rd, pch=21, cex=1)
```


and make a trajectory of the displacement captured by PCA

```{r}
# Visualize first principal component
pc1 <- mktrj(pc.xray, pc=1, file="pc_1.pdb")
```


>Q10. Which of the packages above is found only on BioConductor and not CRAN? 

"msa" is found only in Bioconductor

>Q11. Which of the above packages is not found on BioConductor or CRAN?

"bio3d-view"

>Q12. True or False? Functions from the devtools package can be used to install packages from GitHub and BitBucket?

True

```{r}
# NMA of all structures
modes <- nma(pdbs)
```

```{r}
plot(modes, pdbs, col=grps.rd)
```

>Q14. What do you note about this plot? Are the black and colored lines similar or different? Where do you think they differ most and why?

There are 3 major groups of structures with different motion capability. The black and colored lines are different regarding to their fluctuation capability. The most different part if around residue 50 and residue 130~150 where the colored ones are most fluctuated while the black ones are less fluctuated. It's because the the presence of the ligand affect its flexibility.
